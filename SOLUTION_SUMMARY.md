# AI Chat Thread Management Solution

## Problem Statement
The AI learning system had two critical issues:
1. **Course Switching Bug**: Users switching courses would continue receiving answers from their previous course
2. **Video Content Handling**: Video switches within a course needed better context management

## Root Cause Analysis
- Thread storage was based only on `userId`, not considering course context
- No mechanism to detect video changes within the same course
- Frontend didn't handle course switching properly

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Backend Changes (`aicrafters-backend/src/services/trainerService.ts`)

#### Thread Key Strategy
- **Before**: `threadsByUser.get(userId)` 
- **After**: `threadsByUserAndCourse.get(userId:courseId)`

#### Video Context Management
- Track last video URL per thread to detect video changes
- Add new video context when switching videos within same course
- Preserve conversation continuity within courses

#### Key Functions Added:
```typescript
generateThreadKey(userId: string, courseId: string): string
getOrCreateThreadForUserAndCourse(userId, courseId, context)
addVideoContextToThread(threadId, videoContext)
clearThreadForUserAndCourse(userId, courseId)
getActiveThreadsCount()
```

### 2. Frontend Changes (`aicrafters-frontend/src/hooks/useAIFeatures.ts`)

#### Course Change Detection
- Track current course ID with `useRef`
- Clear chat state when course changes
- Preserve chat state when only video changes within same course

#### State Management
```typescript
// Clear chat state for course switch only
if (currentCourseId.current !== courseId) {
  setMessages([]);
  setThreadId(undefined);
  setChatError(null);
}
```

## Behavior Matrix

| Scenario | Thread Action | Chat State | Context |
|----------|---------------|------------|---------|
| New course | Create new thread | Clear | Fresh context |
| Same course, new video | Reuse thread | Preserve | Add video context |
| Same course, same video | Reuse thread | Preserve | No change |

## Testing Results

✅ **Course Switching**: Different courses get separate threads  
✅ **Video Switching**: Same course maintains thread with updated context  
✅ **Multi-User**: Different users get separate threads per course  

## Benefits

1. **Isolated Course Conversations**: No cross-course contamination
2. **Efficient Context Updates**: Video switches don't restart conversations  
3. **Improved User Experience**: Seamless transitions within courses
4. **Memory Efficient**: Thread reuse within courses
5. **Scalable**: Clear separation by user and course

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `src/services/trainerService.ts` - Main thread management logic
- `docs/ai-chat-thread-management.md` - New documentation

### Frontend  
- `src/hooks/useAIFeatures.ts` - Course change detection and state management

## Deployment Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing threads will continue to work
- **No Database Changes**: Uses in-memory Maps (consider Redis for production)
- **Memory Consideration**: Monitor thread count with `getActiveThreadsCount()`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Storage**: Move thread storage to Redis/Database
2. **Thread Cleanup**: Implement TTL for inactive threads
3. **Analytics**: Track thread usage patterns
4. **Admin Tools**: UI for thread management and monitoring

## Verification

Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd aicrafters-backend
node test-thread-management.js
```

The solution ensures users get contextually appropriate responses based on their current course and video while maintaining conversation continuity within each course.
